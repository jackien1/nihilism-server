# Breakin It Down: _12 Rules for Life_ (Rule 1)

## 31 August 2020

### **Simplified**:

We are lobsters. Don't be a loser lobster. Be a winner lobster. Oh, and stand up straight.

### **Analysis**:

I agree with this rule. And this rule really speaks to be because I am a sloutcher. I'm not exactly sure why I sloutch, maybe I didn't pay that much attention to my posture while spending 10+ hours on the computer each day. Or maybe I have scoliosis. People are really surprised when I tell them I'm actually 6'2 or stand up straight, it's lowkey kinda funny. But yes, I have realized the error of my ways and will now make an active effort to stand up straight. Otherwise, I will be "more likely to fall ill, age rapidly, and die young, with few, if any to mourn \[me\]."
