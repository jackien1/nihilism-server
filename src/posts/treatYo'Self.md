# Breakin It Down: _12 Rules for Life_ (Rule 2)

## 1 September 2020

### **The Rule**:

Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible For Helping

### **Simplified**:

Stop it. Get some help (from yourself). If you can spend hours simping for someone, you can definitely floss everyday.

### **Analysis**:

ðŸ’¯. I see a lot of people, friends, family members, and even myself sometimes struggle to appreciate ourselves. I don't know why. Maybe it's because of the culture we are surrounded by, where altruism is held high and self-serving acts are frowned upon. Maybe it's pirooz damn Zeno of Citium back at it again with the stoicism. Or maybe it actually is because a lady was convinced by a talking snake to eat a magical fruit of knowledge. Who actually knows. Regardless of how this came about, I think it's extremely dumb and counterproductive to undermine our own worth. Shit, the world ain't easy. Sometimes you think you're doing well farming top lane and then bottom ints. The next thing you know, you got mid lane and jungle ganking you from all sides. Not everything is your fault sometimes. And as referenced by Professor Peterson, it's not the worst idea in the world to treat yourself as a friend that needs help. Why is that wrong? People always meme on others for seeing themselves "as the center of the universe." Often times, that's justified. But I think there's nothing wrong with seeing yourself as the center of _your_ universe. I mean, it's just facts. Once you sleep, you don't know everything that's going on around you (the pixels ain't rendering IYKYK). And when you're dead, at least for me, there ain't gonna be nothing. Literally just blank. No past, no present, no future. Sure, you can say some stuff about your legacy moving on but that's another discussion. Life is just one opportunity and putting yourself down just ain't it chief. If life ain't going your way at the moment, there's always time for it to change. Time to improve and time to enjoy the shit life has to offer. At least take care of yourself well enough to live to watch Boruto fight Kawaki. In sum, I'd like to refer to the wise words of Tom Haverford, "treat yo' self!" But don't overdo it though. I mean, we still are just specs in a big ass universe after all.
